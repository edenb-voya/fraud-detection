In this module, you’ll begin thinking about the design, layout, and functionality of your front-end and prototyping your ideas using a wireframing tool.\n",

    "By the next module, the analysts will have studied the data well enough to give specific recommendations about what kind of visualizations to display and what features of the data to include. But before that, we can already brainstorm ideas about how to allow users to interact with a *general* dataset and ML model. We’ll then collaborate with the rest of the group to flesh out our ideas with the specifics of their analysis."
