By now, analysts have become familiar with the data and are starting their exploratory data analysis. The statistics and visualizations they create at this stage are designed to understand the dataset broadly as well as highlight important features through different aggregations--i.e. **exactly** what you want to communicate in your *summary statistics* and *data aggregations* modules. Furthermore, the analysts you work with may eventually need to supply you with the data you'll use for your final product. So incorporating some of their EDA into your design will let you use their already-processed data.\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we get to start building. I'm going to use *create-react-app* to start. I recommend first building most of the underlying UI structure. For me, this will include setting up React Router, maybe adding some boilerplate Redux, and setting up a responsive CSS layout. Using *npx create-react-app* also starts you out with a really convenient Webpack dev server with hot-reloading and [configurable api proxying](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) which is convienent for our microservices architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this architecture, our back-end app will only be concerned with retrieving data. We'll \"compile\" our front-end into production-ready, minified static assets with *npm run build* and then just serve that out of a standalone web server (*nginx*, in our case). These are two separate microservices. Our web server will be configured with the same api reverse proxying as our create-react-app dev server--so regular http requests return our front-end, and specific http requests return our backend endpoints (e.g. `http://${DOMAIN}/api/my-endpoint`).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm also going to start working on my charts. I'm using the React wrapper library for *Chart.js*. If you haven't used a plotting library like this before, you'll need to spend some time with the configuration and learning how to read their documentation. It's often the case for libraries like this that the structure of the documentation itself matches the JSON config's structure--you'll see what I mean when you start using it. At this stage, you should hard-code the dummy data needed for the charts into your UI; and no need to spend too much time on this just yet, the feedback you get from the analysts will affect what charts/data you need.\n",

    "If you take anything away from this course, I hope it's this: ESLint with Prettier will automatically detect style and syntax best practices, accessibility concerns, common mistakes, performance issues, and quietly check static typing. Using this linter and respecting all of its rules will transform you into a better developer over time. Where else can you get professionally-endorsed line-by-line criticism of your code as you type? The rules it detects are defined by a config file; reach out to a mentor if you'd like help adding it to your project. Also, if you're using it with VSCode, this keybinding will change your life forever: *{\"key\": \"alt+a\", \"command\": \"eslint.executeAutofix\"}*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have experience with *create-react-app* and want to take your front-end to the next level, I recommend learning TypeScript. It was annoying at first, but adding TypeScript to my project was as much a breakthrough as adding ESLint. Finally, as for unit-testing, I don't worry about it because I'm lazy and undisciplined. Plus I figure TypeScript + ESLint is good enough. However, if you want to practice adding front-end unit tests, try Jest (or ts-jest).\n"

For now, our back-end is just going to serve the data needed to populate our stats/visualizations. In whatever Python web framework you've chosen, set up a simple HTTP GET endpoint and return a status 200 code plus a JSON array of your data. Make a judgement call here, if you're serving lots of data to your dashboard, break up the endpoints in ways that make sense (e.g. One for *summary statistics*, one for *data aggregations*). In my case, I'm not sending a lot of data, so I'll stick to one endpoint and break up the JSON that I serve into logical parts.\n",
